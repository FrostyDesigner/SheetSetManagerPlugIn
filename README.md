# SheetSetManagerPlugIn
This is a plugIn for the AutoCAD Sheet Set Manager.
It was created in Visual Studio 2019 community edition. 

The project as it stands only exists for one purpose, however additional modules could be added.

It is necesary to have a fully licensed version of AutoCAD installed and configured to use Sheet Sets.

Once AutoCAD is configured, this can be used with the Sheet Set Manager API to batch renames sheets instead of one at a time.

This was completed in 2019, AutoCAD may have created similar functionality by now.

This plugin curently renames the sheet numbers based on user provided parameters instead of user needing to rename sheets one at a time. 

This concludes the scope of this customer request so no further functionality was added. Howver the connection to AutoCAD Sheet Set Manager has been established so additional tools could be added with minimal effort.
